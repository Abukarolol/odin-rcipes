<h3>Discription</h3>
<p>Chimichurri is a dish from Argentina that is usually 
    served over grilled chicken or steak. This is my version,
     which may or may not be authentic. </p>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ul><li><h4>Step one</h4>
    <p>Combine parsley, 2 1/2 tablespoons olive oil, 
        oregano, vinegar, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, 
        and black pepper in a bowl; mix the chimichurri thoroughly.</p>
</li>

<li><h4>Step two</h4>
    <p>Place chicken on a cutting board and remove the 
        backbone using kitchen shears. Press down on the 
        breast with the heel of your hand to flatten. Loosen
         the skin of the chicken carefully and rub the chimichurri 
         underneath, distributing it evenly. Wrap the chicken in plastic
          wrap and refrigerate for 24 hours.</p>
